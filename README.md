# Task 2 – Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

This is **Task 2** of my internship at **CodTech**.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a Python-based scanner to identify common web vulnerabilities such as:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- CLI

## 🚀 How It Works
- Extracts all forms from a webpage
- Submits test payloads for SQLi & XSS
- Reports potential vulnerabilities based on response reflection

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Run:
3. Enter target URL (e.g., `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`)

## ✅ Outcome
The scanner successfully identifies inputs potentially vulnerable to SQLi and XSS.
